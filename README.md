# CNN for Satellite Image Classification
Satellite image classification is the most significant technique used in remote sensing for the computerized study and pattern recognition of satellite information, which is based on diversity structures of the image that involve rigorous validation of the training samples depending on the used classification algorithm.

## What is it?

This is a pytorch implementation of a deep learning model for classification of satellite images. The proposed architecture is based on tranfer learning and uses a ResNet50 classification model as a backbone pre-trained model.

## Requirements
For running the sample code:
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
